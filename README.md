# CoffeeMachine_Simulator
A Python script simulating a Coffee Machine! It tracks Water, Coffee Powder, and Sugar stock. Users order cups, the script calculates ingredient usage, prints per-cup details, and updates the remaining stock. The process repeats until the user quits. Great for learning Python functions, loops, and state management. â˜•
